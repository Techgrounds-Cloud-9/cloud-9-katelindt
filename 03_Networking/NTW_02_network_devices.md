# Network Devices
Network devices are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network.

## Key terminology
- Hub - the most basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices. Unlike a network switch or router, a network hub has no routing tables or intelligence on where to send information and broadcasts all network data across each connection. Most hubs can detect basic network errors, such as collisions, but having all information broadcast to multiple ports is a security risk and causes bottlenecks. In the past, network hubs were popular because they were cheaper than a switch or router. Today, switches do not cost much more than a hub and are a better solution for any network.
