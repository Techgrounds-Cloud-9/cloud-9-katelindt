# Protocols


## Key terminology


## Exercise

- Identify several other protocols and their associated OSI layer. Name at least one for each layer.
- Figure out who determines what protocols we use and what is needed to introduce your own protocol.
- Look into wireshark and install this program. Try and capture a bit of your own network data. Search for a protocol you know and try to understand how it functions.
