# Bash scripting

## Key terminology

- Script
- Bash shell
- Variable
- Path - PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files (i.e., ready-to-run programs) in response to commands issued by a user.

- Commands: 
    


## Exercise 1:

- Create a directory called ‘scripts’. Place all the scripts you make in this directory.
- Add the scripts directory to the PATH variable.
- Create a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it is executed.
- Create a script that installs the httpd package, activates httpd, and enables httpd. Finally, your script should print the status of httpd in the terminal.

## Exercise 2:

- Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file.

## Exercise 3:

- Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file only if the number is bigger than 5. If the number is 5 or smaller, it should append a line of text to that same text file instead.
