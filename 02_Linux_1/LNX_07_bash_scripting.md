# Bash scripting

Input/output and redirection


## Key terminology

- Input
- Output
- Redirection
- Pipe

- Commands: 
    
    - echo - display line of text/string that are passed as an argument. The echo can be used with a redirect operator to output to a file and not standard output.
    - cat - one of its most common usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.
    - grep - command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file. 

## Exercise 1:

- Create a directory called ‘scripts’. Place all the scripts you make in this directory.
- Add the scripts directory to the PATH variable.
- Create a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it is executed.
- Create a script that installs the httpd package, activates httpd, and enables httpd. Finally, your script should print the status of httpd in the terminal.

## Exercise 2:

- Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file.

## Exercise 3:

- Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file only if the number is bigger than 5. If the number is 5 or smaller, it should append a line of text to that same text file instead.
