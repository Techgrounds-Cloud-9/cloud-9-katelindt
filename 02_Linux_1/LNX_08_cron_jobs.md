# Cron jobs




## Key terminology

- Input
- Output
- Redirection
- Pipe

- Commands: 
    
    - echo - display line of text/string that are passed as an argument. The echo can be used with a redirect operator to output to a file and not standard output.
    - cat - one of its most common usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.
    - grep - command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file. 


## Exercise

- Create a Bash script that writes the current date and time to a file in your home directory.
- Register the script in your crontab so that it runs every minute.
- Create a script that writes available disk space to a log file in ‘/var/logs’. Use a cron job so that it runs weekly.
