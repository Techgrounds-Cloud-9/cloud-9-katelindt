# Security Groups

A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.

## Key terminology

A Network Access Control List (NACL) is a stateless firewall that runs on the subnet level in a VPC.
